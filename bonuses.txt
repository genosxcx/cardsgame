BONUS CHALLENGE FORM
--------------------

For each bonus challenge you have implemented, please replace the sentence "We are not entitled to this bonus."
with a short description of:

1. How it was implemented in your code
2. Where it was used (in which class methods).
3. How you tested that it is working correctly.

--------------------

1. Fully supporting all configuration fields and avoiding the use of magic numbers

we used configuration fields when needed and we didnt use any magic words 
we used them in class delaer :
    in the dealer constructor
    method removeAllCardsFromTable
we used them in class player:
    method point()
    method penalty()
we used them in calss table:
    in the table constructor
    method placeCard()
    method removeCard()
    method removeCardd()
we used it in class timeThread:
    in the timeThread constructor
    in method run()

--------------------

2. Terminating all threads (that you created) gracefully and in reverse order to the order they were created in.

we did a reverse for loop in class dealer terminate() methods since the threads id is increased by
1 everytime we create one, reverse for loop for the thread with the highest id(last created thread) to 0(first thread) so they are terminated in reversed order.

--------------------

3. Handling the config.turnTimeoutMillis value as follows:
config.turnTimeoutMillis < 0: display nothing.
config.turnTimeoutMillis = 0: display a timer since the last action (reshuffle or set collected).
Note: in modes without a countdown timer the dealer must ensure there is always at least one legal set on the table.

we created a class for the timer that handles the required bonus for the timer.

--------------------

4. Making sure that the threads do not wake up unless some actual job needs to be done (e.g., a value needs to be
changed on the display, key input needs to be handled, etc.) and the only threads created by you are:
1 thread per player + 1 additional thread for non-human players.

We are not entitled to this bonus.
